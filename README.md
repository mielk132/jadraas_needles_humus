# jadraas_experiment
#organice bags (pine needle litter and humus) incubated in two rounds from 2017-2019.

#datafiles:

#community.txt all samples (background, seq replicates (e.g. dna extracts 60,61), missing samples, neg controls, even mock)
#community2.txt (filtered to 317 samples, took out Mock OTUs)
#community_trimmed.csv (taxa that have greater than 1% relative abundance in at least one sample are retained)


#metadata.txt all 342 samples (background = initial substrates, seq replicates (e.g. dna extracts 60,61), missing samples, neg controls, even mock)
#metadata2.txt all 317 samples (all background, seq reps, missing samples. neg controls and mock are taken out)

#taxa.txt original abundances
#taxa2.txt original abundances (Mock OTUs are removed)
#taxa_trimmed.csv original abundances (taxa that have greater than 1% relative abundance in at least one sample are retained)
